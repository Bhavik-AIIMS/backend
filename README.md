## Tracking India's progress through the coronavirus epidemic. <br/>Every state. Every day. 

It is beyond doubt that reckless relaxation of public health measures and social distancing can have a devastating effect in the form of a rapid rise in COVID-19 cases and deaths. **Relaxation of control measures and return to normal social life must happen in a phased manner, based on continous tracking of public health metrics.** [(WHO,](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/public-health-criteria-to-adjust-public-health-and-social-measures-in-the-context-of-covid-19)[ CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/php/CDC-Activities-Initiatives-for-COVID-19-Response.pdf) These metrics tell us if our hospitals are equipped enough to handle the patient load, whether our testing system is adequate to catch enough cases, whether the rate of spread is under control. 

## Since no one is tracking these important public health indicators and making them available publicly, we are. 

We intend to do this using every bit of publicly available raw data 

As I write this, there is an eerie feeling that tells me that there are enough dashboards tracking COVID-19 in India. But none, like this one. Read me and join in if you find this worth something. 


## Objectives
1. Make a scientifically sound framework which can track the epidemic's progress across multiple relevant domains; based on latest scientific evidence, national advisories and WHO guidance. 
2. Choose appropriate indicators for each domain- Transmission (scale and speed of spread), Testing (testing ramp-up and is it enough), Healthcare system (capacity and outcomes of healthcare). 
3. Integrate required raw data from multiple sources (already existing datasets + de novo data collection).
4. Analyse the raw data through statistically and epidemiologically robust methods to get the desired indicators. 
5. Visualise these indicators in an intuitive and easy-to-understand way on the website, so that people without in-depth knowledge of the topic can understand what we present. 
6. Provide periodical worded analyses of what the numbers show and what that means. We have started that on Twitter (@icart_india), but all ideas are welcome. 
7. Make the indicator datasets publicly available for use by citizens, epidemiologists, researchers, analysts and journalists.


## Raw data sources 

Raw data for cases and tests- www.covid19india.org (A brilliant crowdsourced platform which gathers this data from official state bulletins and dashboards)
Data for mobility index- www.google.com/covid19/mobility
Population data- uidai.gov.in/images/state-wise-aadhaar-saturation.pdf

Limitations of the method are listed under each indicator. If you have an idea to improve upon them, start an issue in this repo.
