# Covid Today | www.covidtoday.in 
## Tracking India's progress through the coronavirus epidemic. Every state. Every day. 

As I write this, there is an eerie feeling that tells me that there are enough dashboards tracking COVID-19 in India. But none, like this one. Read me and join in if you find this worth something. 

## Objectives
1. Make a scientifically sound framework which can track the epidemic's progress across multiple relevant domains, based on latest scientific evidence, national advisories and WHO guidance. 
2. Choose appropriate indicators for each domain- Transmission (scale and speed of spread), Testing (testing ramp-up and is it enough), Healthcare system (capacity and outcomes of healthcare). 
3. Integrate required raw data from multiple sources (already existing datasets + de novo data collection).
4. Analyse the raw data through statistically and epidemiologically robust methods to get the desired indicators. 
5. Visualise these indicators in an intuitive and easy-to-understand way on the website, so that people without in-depth knowledge of the topic can understand what we present. 
6. Provide periodical (weekly?) worded analyses of what the numbers show and what that means. We have started that on Twitter (@icart_india), but all ideas are welcome. 
7. Update these indicators as frequently as possible. 
8. Make the indicator datasets publicly available for use by citizens, epidemiologists, researchers, analysts and journalists.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment
for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

    Give examples

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development
env running

Say what the step will be

    Give the example

And repeat

    until finished

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it
for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

    Give an example

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

    Give an example

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
